Liv er damage can be life-threatening,\nespecially in the elderly. If you suffer from multiple sclerosi s, the risk of serious liver damage appears to be even higher.\nDantrium may cause the sk in to become sensitive to light (photosensitisation), so you should pr otect\nyourself from strong sunlight duri ng treatment.\nAdministration of Dant rium must be discontinu ed if patients have developed cardiac and pleural\nreactions with fluid accumulation (pl eural or pericardial effusion or pleuropericarditis).\nDoses of more th an 200 mg dantrolene per day are more li kely to cause side effects.\nThis medicine contains only ve ry low levels of gluten (from wheat starch). It is regarded as ‘gluten -\nfree’ and is very unlikely to cause problems if you have coeliac disease.\nOne Dantrium 25mg capsule contains no more than 3.8 m icrograms of gluten.\nOne Dantrium 100mg capsule contains no more than 3.3 micrograms of gluten.\nChildren\nDantrium can be used in children over 5 years of age under supervision from your doctor.\nDantrium should not be given to children under 5 years of age as there is insufficient exp erience with\nthe use of Dantr ium in this patient group to determine tolerability.\nOther medicines and Dantrium\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking/usin g or have recently tak en/used any other\nmedicines, even if they are not prescription medicat ions.\nIf taken at the same ti me as\n- oestrogens (certain hormones) or other potentially liver -damag ing substances there is an\nincreased risk of liver damage,\n- vecuroni um (muscle relaxant dr ug) its effect can be amplified,\n- metoclop ramide (a medicine used to tr eat certain gastrointestinal disorders), the\nabsorption of the active ingredient of Dantrium in the body may be increased, leading to\nan increase in the effect and side effects of dantro lene.\n3\nSimultaneous use of medicines that depress the central nervous system (sedatives, such as\nbenzodiazepines, antihistamines) and alcohol is to be avoided as the si de effects of Dantrium may be\nincreased (in particular the central nervous system depressant effect and muscle weakness).\nIn patie nts predisposed to malignant hyperthermia (certain complications of anaesthesia) who received\nintravenous dantrolene, it has b een observed that simultaneous administration of calcium antagonist s\nand/or beta -blockers (antihypertensive/heart disease drugs) r esulted in elevated potassium levels and\ncardiac insuffici ency.\nDantrium with food and drink\nDo not drink alcohol while taking Dantrium.\nPregnancy and breast -feeding\nDantrium should not be used during pregnancy, as the safety of Dantrium for use during pre gnancy\nhas not been establish ed.\nThe active substance of Dantrium passes into breast milk. Dantrium should not be used while bre ast-\nfeeding, since adverse effects on the breastfed child cannot be excluded, particula rly under long-term\ntreatment with Dantri um. Breast -feeding must be di scontinued if treatment is re quired while breast -\nfeeding.\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advic e before taking/using any medicine.\nDriving and using machines\nYou must not drive or oper ate machinery without consulting your doc tor.\nWhen Dant rium or other medicines that also affect the central nervous system are taken at the same\ntime, central ner vous system effects, such as drowsiness or confusion, can change th e ability to react\nto such an extent that it reduces the ability to drive or operate tools a nd machines. This particularly\napplies at the start of treatment, when dosage is increased and wh en taken together with alcohol.\nDantrium Capsules contain lactose and wheat starch .\nThis medicine contains lactose and wheat starch. If you have been told by your doctor t hat you have\nan intolerance to some sugars, speak to your doctor before taking this medicine.\n"
